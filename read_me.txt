Pet project goal: 
Conduct full cycle AB-test. Deal with each steps of experiment from collecting logs, defining metrics, data analysis, statmodeling and making conclusion.
Form representation of the semantic necessity of each stage and its connections with the following.
Deepen conducting methodology of experiments.

Competencies being worked out:
1. SQL
2. EDA and Statmodeling by Python
3. Methods metrics sensitivity increasing (CUPED, Weighted Linearization)
4. Advanced methods of conducting stattest and metrics validations (Bootstrap and AA-test)
5. GIT
6. Providing results to requester


Context: 
We released new interface feature on all platforms and want to know is it helpful for our users and is there profit for our product and business.


Exp start: 2022-06-30 
Exp fin: 2022-07-13
Raw data in: app_logs.csv

Main steps:
0. Define success metrics (1-3 conversion, 2-4 quantify, 2-4 ratio)
1. Transform raw data to user metrics format
2. Explore metrics behaviour
3. Increase metrics sensitivity via CUPED and Weighted Linearization
4. Validate metrics using AA-test
5. Use stat criterions to define is differences are significant 
6. Make conclusion
